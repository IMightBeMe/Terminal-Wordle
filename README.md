# Terminal-Wordle

A simple wordle game made in java and meant to be played in the terminal.

You play the game just like normal wordle. You have six tries to guess the word. When you guess a word, your guess will change colors based on the letter.
If a letter is in the right place, it will turn green
If a letter is in the wrong place, but is in the word, then it will turn blue
Finally, if a letter isn't in the word at all, then it will turn gray.

Use these clues to guess the word!
